# 4. Develop the software independently

Date: 2024-03-01

## Context

The organization for which we were developing the software has too many organization changes and can't introduce new processes to its employees until further notice. We need to adapt to continue the development of the software on our own.

## Decision

We will develop the software as if we were a SaaS (Software as a Service). This way, we can continue the development of the software without having to worry about the organization's changes. We will not go too deep into the modules we develop because we can't predict the organization's future needs.

## Consequences

We will stop developing new modules for now and finish the modules we are currently developing, bringing them to a stable version.
