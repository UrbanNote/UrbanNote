# 5. Open Source the Project

Date: 2024-03-01

## Context

Following the mindset change of development towards an independent approach, and knowing this started as a school project that will end in two months, we need to decide what to do with the project after the school project ends.

## Decision

We will open-source the project on GitHub. This way, we can continue the development of the project after the school project ends, and other developers can contribute to the project. It may also be forked and used as a base for other organizations with specific needs.

## Consequences

We will have to migrate the repository on GitHub, since as of right now, it is hosted on our school's self-managed GitLab. This will be done at the end of the semester. We will also need to offer enough documentation and guidelines for other developers to contribute to the project. This will also help us to keep the project alive and updated after the school project ends.
