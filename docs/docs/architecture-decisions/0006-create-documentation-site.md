# 6. Create a Documentation Site

Date: 2024-03-15

## Context

As the project will be open-sourced, we need to provide documentation for developers to understand how the project works, how to contribute, and how to use the project. We also need to provide documentation for the end-users to understand how to use the project.

## Decision

We will create a documentation site using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/). Docusaurus is a static site generator that is easy to use and has a lot of features that will help us create a documentation site quickly. It also has a lot of themes and plugins that will help us customize the documentation site to our needs.

## Consequences

Efforts will be made to create and deploy the site, as well as migrate existing private documents such as the API reference and utilisation guide.
